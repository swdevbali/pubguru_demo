### FEATURES WRAP UP
Good news for fetcher bug handling: it seems like as if we handle fetcher bugs more aggresively last sprint, 
now in this sprint, we only encounter smaller number of them. Only 4 of them, while last sprint we handle around 20 of them. 
---
For fetcher bug handling, we are developing a fetcher prioritization index, so that we can handle fetcher bug in a better way,
by designating importancy for fetchers based on the ad network last 30 days revenue divided by 30 .

All and all, these are the major features that has been implemented in this sprint:
---
- Migrating Configurator from tools into pubguru |
- Notifications improvements: (1) filtering notifications based on user related pubs and (2) we already have notification template for adops to use  |
- As usual, lots of backend/server improvements |
---
### THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
- As usual, we still have lots of room for improvement.|
- Mainly the way we do Code Review need to be improved, as that phase is the longest to take and may block our speed of acquiring story points for a sprint. | 
- Probably, as suggessted by Anton, we can make Friday as the official day of Code Review-ing.  |
- Also, now we are deploying new features to production every early Monday |
