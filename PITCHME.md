Stuff that we are focus on:

### 1. Notifications Improvement

- Need several attempt to make right, but after issuing a survey to adops, we found lots of great ideas to implements|
- Some are implemented here, some aren't (to be discuss in the next sprint) |

### THAT'S ALL
- Improvement for next sprint, will be to evaluate our strength (in term of story points in this sprint), and try to calculate better estimates |
